# Sumatra
JVM implementation on Kotlin without any external dependencies, doing this mostly for fun

Copied some code structures from [k0kubun/jjvm](https://github.com/k0kubun/jjvm), I'm trying to not copy everything though hehe

# Target
 - Be able to parse .class files
 - Be able to execute classes
 - Mostly comply with the [Java SE 11 virtual machine specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se11/html/)
 - NO EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES (except for the kotlin stdlib)
